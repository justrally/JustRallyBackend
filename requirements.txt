I am creating a skeleton project for a Next.js project

1. Create a new Next.js project
2. create a new auth-api that uses firebase auth
for the client side, if it is new users, it will need to login with phone number and code.
once it is logged in, it does not need to login again until logout.
any following requests should be authenticated with JWT token.
please design api meets these requirements.
5. should deploy to both dev and prod environments. push to github and deploy to dev and prod gcp.
6. should have a dockerfile for each service.
7. use github for version control.
8. use github actions for deployment.
9. use github actions for CI/CD.
10. add linting and formatting.

help me organize these requirements more clearly. give me any suggestions needed. but ask me first.
